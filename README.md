# xss-dom-analyzer
 This Python script analyzes the HTML content of a given URL and identifies the attributes where specific queries are reflected. It provides a way to determine if user input is being properly sanitized and protected against potential security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  Usage Run the script using the following command:  shell Copy code python reflection_analyzer.py --url <url> --queries <query1,query2,...> Replace <url> with the target URL to analyze and <query1,query2,...> with one or more queries separated by commas. The script will fetch the HTML content of the URL, search for the queries, and highlight the reflected attributes in a different color.  If no reflection is found for a query, it will be indicated in the output as "No reflection found."  Example To analyze the HTML reflection on a website with the URL https://example.com for queries "name" and "email", use the following command:  shell Copy code python reflection_analyzer.py --url https://example.com --queries name,email The script will parse the HTML content of the provided URL, search for the queries, and display the attributes where the queries are reflected, if any.  Note: Make sure to have the required Python libraries (requests, beautifulsoup4, and termcolor) installed before running the script. You can install them using pip:  shell Copy code pip install requests beautifulsoup4 termcolor Feel free to customize the script or add more functionality as needed.
